This is a rogue-lite game currently in development, drawing inspiration from titles like Hades and from comic books. The game's concept and mechanics continue to evolve as development progresses.

As a foundational step, I've completed work on procedural dungeon generation. This system allows for controlled generation of dungeons, with the ability to specify parameters such as the number and size of rooms, the different rooms that we want to spawn and their chance of spawning, etc. Additionally, it's designed to accommodate future features if needed.

One key aspect of gameplay revolves around map destruction, leading to the implementation of various types of walls: indestructible, hard-to-destroy, and easy-to-destroy. These walls are currently visually differentiated by color, with darker shades indicating higher durability. Additionally, players will spawn in green rooms and aim to reach red rooms to exit the dungeon.

Check out this video for a glimpse of how the dungeon generation is currently working:
